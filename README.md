Simple React Code Editor with PrismJS
This project is a basic code editor built using React that provides syntax highlighting functionality. It leverages the following technologies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
PrismJS: A popular library for adding syntax highlighting to code.
Prism React Renderer: A React component that integrates PrismJS for syntax highlighting within React applications.
Textarea HTML Element: A standard HTML element for creating a multi-line text input field.
Functionality:

Users can enter code within the provided textarea element.
PrismJS, integrated through the Prism React Renderer, highlights the code based on the detected language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, HTML).
This offers a clear visual distinction between different code elements like keywords, functions, comments, and strings.
Benefits:

Improved code readability and maintainability.
Easier debugging by visually identifying potential syntax errors.
Provides a foundation for building more advanced code editors with features like line numbers, auto-completion, and undo/redo functionality.
Implementation:

Project Setup:
Create a new React project using tools like Create React App.
Install Dependencies:
Install prismjs and prism-react-renderer using npm or yarn.
Code Editor Component:
Create a React component for the code editor.
Use a textarea element to allow users to enter code.
Import the Prism object and language definition from prismjs and prism-react-renderer respectively.
Define a state variable to store the code content.
Implement an onChange handler for the textarea to update the state with the entered code.
Use the Prism.highlight function to highlight the code based on the detected language and the stored content.
Render the highlighted code within a pre element using the Prism.jsx component from prism-react-renderer.
